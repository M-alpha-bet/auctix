This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

The one spot for unique lots

This is a demo build that displays unique lots for buyers to bid. I used sanity as the Content Management System for managing lot content and I found it really easy to use. I used OAuth's Github authentication for logging users in. You can login and create a lot which will be updated immediately using Sanity. I made use of amazing nextJS features like SSR, Caching, Image and font optimizations. I used sentry as the performance monitoring and error tracking system. I used GSAP very lightly for the animations. I had fun building this, hope you enjoy this.
