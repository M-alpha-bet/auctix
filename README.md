The one spot for unique lots

This is a demo build that displays unique lots for buyers to bid. I used sanity as the Content Management System for managing lot content and I found it really easy to use. I used OAuth's Github authentication for logging users in. You can login and create a lot which will be updated immediately using Sanity. I made use of amazing nextJS features like SSR, Caching, Image and font optimizations. I used sentry as the performance monitoring and error tracking system. I used GSAP very lightly for the animations. I had fun building this, hope you enjoy this.
